# Tetris-Wireless-Controller

This was the final project for ECE 16 (Rapid hardware and software design for interfacing with the world)

For this project my team programmed a wireless arduino to control a game of tetris on a PC/MAC.


Motivation: 

Design EMG/IMU driven prostheses for transradial amputees and individuals with hand motor impairments
(And to win!!)


Challenges

EMG Signal characteristics can vary from subject to subject, as well as within subject!

Fatigue! You may want to minimize the effort required for control so that you don’t get tired.

Grading Rubric

Technical (60%):
A plot with the simultaneous output from any 2 sensors (20%).  
This could be an EMG channel or an axis of the accelerometer or gyroscope sensor.  You can plot these on the same axes or on different axes using subplot.
A plot that is time synchronized to (a) that maps these two sensors to a button push command for one or more buttons (20%).
Again, these could be plotted on the same axes or on different axes using subplot.  You can use “0” to represent that the button is not being pushed and “1” to represent that it is being pushed.
A description of these plots (20%).
This description can be oral and will be delivered when we meet to discuss the checkpoint.
(a) and (b) can either be live streaming OR generated from saved files that you plot.
Strategy (40%): 
A description of your primary strategy for control (10%)
Potential shortcomings / challenges to this approach (10%)
Alternative approaches if you run into trouble (5%)
Your plan to implement this strategy (15%)


The team that wins the maximum matches wins the competetion.
